Inspired by the roots of an original Drum'n'Bass vibe, Polish/Indian New Zealand producer Obeisant imprints his forward-pushing energy into the genre.

Characterized by breakbeats and a raw sense of urgency, Sebastian (Obeisant) embodies a Punk and Hip-Hop attitude, with dance and rock-music production values. The sum of these parts is what constructs Obeisant.

Sebastian cites artists such as Tool and Radiohead for their arrangements and layers, and The Prodigy and Chemical Brothers' rebellious energy as some of his top inspirations outside of Drum'n'Bass. This is similar to his DnB heroes Dillinja, Total Science, Source Direct, Goldie, and Photek, and says, "...their music connected with me in the same way."

Kasra [label owner] signed Obeisant for his debut release on the seminal 'Critical' imprint, and he also received support early on from Resound, Lockjaw, and John Rolodex. Rene LaVice featured the mammoth Future-Jungle track 'Adore You' on his BBC Radio 1xtra show.

Obeisant's output has been a consistent turnover of, in his words, "Further refining my sound palate, and getting the sounds out of my head and into a track. That's ongoing."

His music is found on Critical, Program, Lifestyle, Locked Concept, T3K, and Machinist Music. At a live DJ set, one could expect the same 'street-vibe' and attitude as his productions, weaving together his own taste in Jungle, Neurofunk, Tech, and Moody-Deep groovers.

The future is steadily pushing forward, both in-and-out of the studio, the dancefloor, and beyond, with eyes set on film, television, and videogames.
