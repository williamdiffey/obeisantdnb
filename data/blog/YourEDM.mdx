Obeisant is an artist from New Zealand who got a mighty push in 2017 by being discovered by the Critical label for their Binary series. Since then he’s also caught the eye of RAM Records, with his “On My Mind” single from the Critical EP finding its way onto RAM’s 2017 Annual compilation. He’s also featured on the Lifestyle label annual for his track with Victim and another remix album for RAM. He’s also put out two EPs since the Binary release: Twin on Locked Concept and just last month the On Time EP on RAM’s sister label, ProgRAM. Suffice it to say Obeisant has put together quite a catalog in the short time he’s been releasing.

Your EDM caught up with Obeisant between the Twin and On Time releases to find out about his process. The New Zealander’s style is an interesting mix of early 2000s-inspired neurofunk tactics and modern techniques, so we encouraged him to get technical. We were rewarded mightily. For upcoming producers and fans who love the techy end of things, this is the interview for you.
